ezpath
======

*Note: This program is NOT safe! It could delete files or mess up
filenames or both or other things. I really don't know and I don't trust
it. Consider it deprecated -- please use [raehik/ezstring][] together
with `mv` instead.*

`ezpath` moves files to their 'shell-friendly' equivalent: i.e. no caps,
annoying punctuation, or spaces etc. to make using the filename in a
shell safer and easier. Check the file itself to see the substitutions
done.
